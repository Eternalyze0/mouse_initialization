# Mouse Initialization

We pretrain a neural network to replicate the brain activity of a mouse for improved performance. The brain activity data is extracted from https://github.com/int-brain-lab/paper-brain-wide-map. The baseline for the DQN is from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seungeunrho/minimalRL/refs/heads/master/dqn.py.
